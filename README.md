# Streamlit App for Advanced Product Experimentation and Impact Analysis
📊 A/B Test Simulator & Feature Launch Analyzer

Overview:
This project is a hands-on tool that simulates A/B testing for product feature launches, enabling product teams to estimate the impact of new features on key metrics such as conversion rate and user engagement—before deployment.

Problem Solved:
Product and growth teams often struggle to validate whether new features will drive meaningful impact without investing heavily in development or waiting for real-world data. This tool bridges that gap by allowing quick experimentation and statistical validation in a simulated environment.

Includes:
- ✅ A/B Testing
- 📊 Multivariate Testing (ANOVA via `scipy`)
- 🧠 Bayesian Inference (Beta distribution)
- 🎯 Multi-arm Bandit Simulation
- 📈 Propensity Score Matching for Causal Inference
